# Credit Fraud Detection

<p> I have been tasked to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.</li>
  <li>Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
  
  <li>Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.</li>

  <li>Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.</li>
</ul>
<p> Step 1: Understanding the problem/ objective goals</p>
<p>The goal is to classify transactions into two classes: fraudulent and genuine.</p>

<p>Step 2: Data preprocessing </p>
<p>This step includes cleaning (handling null values etc)and normalizing the data </p>

<p>Python Libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas- data analysis and manipulation</li>
  <li>Numpy- for Calculations</li>
  <li>Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn- for visualizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3: Dealing with imbalances in our data </p>
<p>This is crucial because we are dealing with a dataset that has the potential to for undersampling or oversmapling. This is something that needs to be considered</p>

<p>Python Libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scikit-Learn: imported SMOTE, random forest, imbalance</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4: Splitting the data into training / testing</p>
<p> Dividing the data into training and testing sets</p>

<p>Step 5: Deciding on a classification algorithm</p>
<p> I went with Rnadom Forest and will be testing with other algorithms as I test</p>

<p> Step 6: Training the model</p>
<p> Step 7: Model Evaluation</p>

<h2>Final thoughts:</h2>
<p> This particular task was challenging for me. I did not expect for it to take three days to complete, however I was met with challenges for example I do not have alot of experience with some algorithms and making a choice was difficult at first. I encountered errors in the process which I had to troubleshoot, at one point I just had to stay away from the computer lol</p>


<h1>Project 2: Sales Predictions</h1>

<h2>Sales Predictions</h2>

<p>This project scope of the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.</li>
<li>In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential using machine learning in Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem I will be focusing on solving is : How can we predict sales by focusing on honing in on these factors: target audience segmentation, advertising expenditure and advertising platform selection</p>
<p>These are the stepes I will be following to solve this particular problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define the problem</li>
<li>Gather the data</li>
<li>Explore the date (using python libraries</li>

<li>Model the data</li>
<li>test the model</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project it was simply and straight to the point, compared to the previous project this was my favorite, I will attribute that to domain knowledge</p>
