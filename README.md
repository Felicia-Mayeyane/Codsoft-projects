# Credit fraud detection

<p> I have been tasked to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.</li>
  <li>Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
  
  <li>Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.</li>

  <li>Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.</li>
</ul>
<p> Step 1: Understanding the problem/ objective goals</p>
<p>The goal is to classify transactions into two classes: fraudulent and genuine.</p>

<p>Step 2: Data preprocessing </p>
<p>This step includes cleaning (handling null values etc)and normalizing the data </p>
<p>Python Libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas- data analysis and manipulation</li>
  <li>Numpy- for Calculations</li>
  <li>Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn- for visualizations</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3: Dealing with imbalances in our data </p>
<p>This is crucial because we are dealing with a dataset that has the potential to for undersampling or oversmapling. This is something that needs to be considered</p>

<p>Python Libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scikit-Learn: imported SMOTE, random forest, imbalance</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4: Splitting the data into training / testing</p>
<p> Dividing the data into training and testing sets</p>

<p>Step 5: Deciding on a classification algorithm</p>
<p> I went with Rnadom Forest and will be testing with other algorithms as I test</p>

<p> Step 6: Training the model</p>
<p> Step 7: Model Evaluation</p>

<h2>Final thoughts:</h2>
<p> This particular task was challenging for me. I did not expec for it to take three days to complete, however I was met with challenges for example I do not have alot of experience with some algorithms and making a choice was difficult at first</p>
