<h2>Sales Predictions</h2>

<p>This project scope of the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.</li>
<li>In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential using machine learning in Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem I will be focusing on solving is : How can we predict sales by focusing on honing in on these factors: target audience segmentation, advertising expenditure and advertising platform selection</p>
<p>These are the stepes I will be following to solve this particular problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define the problem</li>
<li>Gather the data</li>
<li>Explore the date (using python libraries</li>
<li>Visualize the data</li>
<li>Model the data</li>
<li>test the model</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project it was simply and straight to the point, compared to the previous project this was my favorite, I will attribute that to domain knowledge</p>
